The great DiMaggio’s father was a fisherman. And so was Santiago.

He is the sort of hero of The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway’s acclaimed novella that secured him the Nobel Prize for Literature. 

The premise of the book reminded me of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, an epic poem about a sailor cursed for murdering an albatross. I was 17 when I read it at school. I hated it, completely and totally. Probably I was too young for it. Luckily, The Old Man and the Sea hit different. This story resonated with me profoundly. I wanted to take some time to explore what I think makes this work so special.

I grew up right by the sea, but I never spent much time in it (cold, slimy, a bit gross?). What I did spend a lot of time doing though was going to the aquarium, one of the only attractions the nearby city boasted. Aquariums are funny places. Human beings are conditioned to see fish as objects of beauty, with the thick pane of glass both physically and mentally separating the human being from the sea life they are observing. This cultivates an artificial sense of detachment from the animal world. After each visit, we would leave the aquarium and smell the sea air, then order fish and chips without a second thought as to how the fish ended up coated in batter. 

### There is no one worthy of eating him

Hemingway shatters this glass, the imagined barrier between ourselves and marine life. His framing of fishing as gruelling, gory, and brutal is honest and unflinching. Now I’m not going to make out that Hemingway was some sort of animal rights activist, but there is a gravitas attached to Santiago’s hunting of the fish that is totally absent from modern man’s relationship to his food, purchased from a supermarket, wrapped in plastic. Time seems to slow down in Santiago’s boat as he engages in a multi-day battle of endurance with the fish he has hooked. He catches smaller fish to sustain himself, fantasising about adding salt and lime to improve the flavour.

Santiago’s relationship to animals is complex. His vocation as a fisherman has him subjugate and conquer the creatures he pursues, but also puts him in close proximity to sea life. Through this proximity, Santiago has developed a feeling of kinship towards the creatures he comes across while at sea. For Santiago, his poverty further connects him to non-human animals. In instructing the bird to “take your chance like any man or bird or fish” Santiago considers himself alongside animals as equals, each attempting to survive. 

It would be deeply simplistic to characterise Santiago as a reluctant, subsistence fisherman. He is dedicated to his craft and his pursuit of the fish verges on a sport. Santiago’s gratification is a major source of the guilt that sets in once he has killed the fish. He knows that his motivations were impure. 

> “You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman”.

Because Santiago is not a commercial fisherman using industrial tools, his battle with the fish feels like a fairer fight. The fish is blessed with excellent physical attributes, including a scythe like tail, while Santiago’s tools are his hands, which wield the harpoon. Yet, Santiago expresses a deep reverence for the worthiness of this fish, especially once he fully beholds it at the very moment he kills it.

> “Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty”

Having at last properly seen the fish, Santiago considers the creature one “more noble and more able” than he, only bested “through trickery”. Santiago knows he has somehow violated the laws of nature. He contemplates whether he has committed a sin by killing the fish, even after having prayed to successfully kill and reel in the fish in the first place. For Santiago, who has spent his life honing his craft as a fisherman, this comes across as a solemn sort of existential crisis. He now feels that it would be somehow wrong for human beings to gain sustenance from the fish.

> “There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity”

That Santiago’s prized fish is destroyed by sharks is a cosmic sort of irony. Nobody but Santiago bore witness to the size and excellence of the fish or tasted its meat. As the sharks approach to restore balance, Santiago becomes increasingly resigned to his loss, robbed of his glory. He finds beauty even in the sharks (“everything about him was beautiful except his jaws”) who strip the fish of all flesh, returning again and again to “hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table”.

Hemingway deftly weaves together these conflicting motivations into a story that fosters pity for Santiago, a sense of righteous justice for the fish, and an unshakeable melancholy. 

### I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today

This particular fishing expedition is also imbued with a sense of urgency and finitude owing to Santiago’s age. Hemingway depicts him as a man fading away. His eyesight isn’t what it was. He seldom eats. His living quarters are at most utilitarian. At the point we meet Santiago he has been on a long losing streak and any lust for life he once had has long left him.

> “He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife”

As the story unfolds, we see Santiago’s renewed vigour throughout his standoff with the fish, which sours to regret and resignation as the sharks circle in and destroy his prize catch. His once reliable tools are decaying. His left hand in particular betrays him by developing cramp “as stiff as rigor mortis”. He addresses his left hand as though it is separate from himself, considering cramp a “treachery of one’s own body” that “humiliates oneself especially when one is alone”.

Besting the fish and resisting his inevitable physical decline are linked for Santiago. This is a story of an old man’s futile struggle to preserve his honour in the face of inevitable failure. In fighting against his own fatigue, Santiago conjures the power of his hero Joe DiMaggio. Presumably Santiago aspires to be the Joe DiMaggio of fishermen. Despite a run of bad luck, Santiago is written as something of a maritime clairvoyant, his intuitions honed by decades of experience. Like DiMaggio, he must persevere towards greatness. 

> “But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel”

Hemingway uses baseball to anchor Santiago, who is otherwise drifting alone out at sea. Towards the beginning of the story Santiago and Manolin, the boy he has been mentoring, discuss the great baseball players. Debating who the GOAT is seems to be a near universal male trait. It reminds me of [this (imo iconic) tweet](https://x.com/EMHudsonlives/status/1415513767337762817?lang=en). 

> Dudes can literally just sit around and name old sports players and just have the best time.

There is something boyish in how Santiago speaks about baseball, his admiration for Joe DiMaggio, and his feeling that there is some kinship between himself and DiMaggio owing to his father also being a fisherman.

> “They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.”

This particular sentence hangs in the air unfinished. We are left to consider what specifically it is that would need to be understood. Through the narrative we are told, we can hazard a guess that Santiago is referring to the specific relationship the fisherman has to the ocean: the patience, exhaustion, poverty, and desperation baked into the vocation. We learn that this fishing trip might kill Santiago off, leaving him with a feeling that “something in [his] chest was broken”. It’s a downbeat ending for sure. Santiago’s body and spirit have both given in under the weight of capturing and losing the fish. Glory eludes him. 

The Old Man and the Sea is desolate and surprisingly knotty given its only 100 pages long. So many have excavated this work for symbolism, biblical allusions, and political significance. For me, its Santiago that I can’t stop thinking about.

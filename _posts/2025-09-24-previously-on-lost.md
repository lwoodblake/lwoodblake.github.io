Have we tried switching The Island off and on again?

<!-- more -->
Despite several people in my life trying to ward me away (“you know how that show ends right?”), I have spent the past 6 months watching Lost. The combination of mysticism, sci-fi, and compelling characters got me hooked, but given its reputation I was still nervous about watching the final episode. 

Having now seen it for myself, and having subsequently consumed pages and pages of internet discourse about it, I have come to believe that the Lost finale is like a Rorschach test in that how each person interprets it says more about that person than anything. Nonetheless, here’s my initial interpretation on first viewing. I hope that this story can be one I return to again and again, finding something new each time.

### The Heart of The Island

No doubt The Island is special, as Locke correctly intuits from the start when he regains his ability to walk after years in a wheelchair. The finale does not reveal why The Island is special, but we do get to see more of one of the most important locations on The Island. The climax of the action on The Island centres on The Heart of The Island, a bright yellow light emanating from a tunnel in a mysteriously concealed location on The Island. We never learn on a scientific level what The Heart is or what its function is, but we do bear witness to its power.

The simplest description would be that the light is a form of electromagnetic energy, some sort of life force that imbues The Island with its magic. As people tend to do when there are coveted resources deep underground, several groups of people have attempted to extract this light to use it for their own ends. The Dharma Initiative certainly hoped to harness the energy for all sorts of weird ends. The Man in Black’s (MiB) people spend their time digging wells in an effort to escape The Island. The Heart itself appears to be another location where people long ago attempted to unleash The Island’s energy. At some point people found it necessary to stick a cork in the hole in the ground from where the light is leaking out to prevent disaster.

Even Jacob exploited The Island for his own gain by using it as a weapon. When he throws his brother into The Heart he does so ignorant to the consequences and unwittingly unleashes a monster, as we see first hand in “Across the Sea”. While undoubtedly my least favourite episode of Lost, “Across the Sea” does serve to show us first hand what Jacob actually knows about The Island, which turns out to be very little. Jacob is shown The Heart and is told by the woman that raised him that he must protect The Heart (he has no choice in the matter). He learns everything else about The Island on the job. 

It follows from this that each protector simply does what they think will be best for The Island. I saw the ritual of being appointed protector as more of a symbolic act, a declaration of total commitment. Both Jack and Hurley go through the process of becoming protectors and neither of them appear to have a profound moment of revelation as they partake in the ritual. I’m of the opinion that nothing changes for you when you drink from the cup, only that you have taken on a role of responsibility. Becoming The Island’s protector seems a lot like becoming a parent. It’s scary, but you take your responsibility seriously, you try your best, and work it out as you go. 

This feels appropriate given that parenthood is a key theme across the series. That The Incident in 1977 prevented women from being able to give birth on The Island is a big part of what has made The Others so weird. Their society cannot procreate, so they resort to stealing children from any outsiders that reach The Island. Almost every character on the show has been emotionally damaged by an awful father and we see Claire, Kate, Desmond, Sun and Jin all become parents over the series. In the finale, Claire voices her fears around returning to civilisation, which centre around her concerns that she will fail as a mother. 

> CLAIRE: Look at me! This Island's made me crazy, I--I don't want Aaron to see me like this. I don't even know how to be a mother anymore.  
KATE: Listen to me, none of us do. Not at first. But you're not alone. Let me help you. Come on, let's go.


The first step to protecting The Island is saving it from immediate destruction.

### One More Leap of Faith

Almost everything that the survivors of Oceanic 815 face, every decision they must make, is done with imperfect information. There is so much that the survivors do not understand about The Island, about The Others, about each other, but they have to act in a way that ensures the group’s survival. This uncertainty is also present for the final showdown of the series. Both Jack and The MiB want to destroy each other, but they both think that they can achieve their goals so by performing the same action, exposing Desmond to The Heart. The MiB believes that pushing Desmond into the light will cause The Island to sink. Jack believes it will kill The MiB. 

Whether events on The Island are actually of cosmic significance is also left open. There are several discussions of the existential threat the MiB poses should he succeed in leaving The Island, but when the cork is removed, we only witness the on-island ramifications. The Island begins to fall into the ocean and The Island’s magic is suspended. The MiB is now mortal. He bleeds and can die. If the real John Locke were here I have no doubt that he would once again find himself unable to walk. 

Jack needs to put the cork back in place not to save the world, but because the ground they are all standing on is falling into the ocean. Jack’s sacrifice mattered because it meant Kate and Claire could be reunited with Aaron and Desmond could go back to his wife and young son. When a dying Jack sees the Ajira plane flying across the sky he knows he has achieved what he needed to. His friends are safe. 

This is a dynamic present for a lot of the weird goings on in Lost. It was a good thing that the survivors opened The Hatch back in season one, not because of all the information we learned about the Dharma Initiative, but because it turned out that a suicidal Desmond was living alone in there and he needed help and companionship. The mysteries of The Island have always been secondary to the journey our characters go on together, the support they provide each other. 

### Everybody Loves Hugo

Once Jack sacrifices himself to restore The Heart of The Island, the role of protector transfers to Hurley. In many ways Hurley has the more difficult job. The Island has been exploited for millennia and its history is one of violence and mass murder. Hurley must now attempt to break that cycle. 

The Island is often spoken about as though it is hell on earth. Almost all of our survivors spend the entire series trying to leave The Island. Yet this is a place that can heal a person of debilitating disease and that can induce transformative spiritual experiences in those open to its powers.  I see The Island as an unrealised paradise. Deliberately separated from the conflicts and missions the other survivors have been swept up in, Rose and Bernard have lived happy lives on The Island enjoying the beach and each others company. This extra time afforded to them would not have been possible had The Island not cured Roses’ cancer. 

How to foster a society of people that can live and thrive on The Island is a tough question and it isn’t a question the show attempts to answer. In earlier seasons of Lost (before Ben Linus, before Charles Widmore, before time travel, before The MiB) our survivors are focused on how to live together, how to ration food, handle disagreements, build shelters. They do a half decent job of it and even find time to have some fun, like in the episode where the boys take an abandoned Dharma van on a joy ride. 

We can assume that Hurley will be a very different protector to Jacob, a lone wolf whose refusal to lead or even to be seen . While Jacob’s insistence on solitude was his undoing, the first thing Hurley does as protector is ask for help. When seeking support from the only person left with him on The Island, Ben reminds him of his kindness. They now have an opportunity to rewrite the rules together. The rules were never divine commandments, just one flawed man’s idea of how to protect The Island. 

> HURLEY: It's my job now... What the hell am I supposed to do?  
BEN: I think you do what you do best. Take care of people. You can start by helping Desmond get home.  
HURLEY: But how? People can't leave the Island.  
BEN: That's how Jacob ran things... Maybe there's another way. A better way.


Its apt that Hurley’s right hand man should be Benjamin Linus, a slippery weasel of a villain, given Hurley’s open-mindedness. Back in the season 4 episode Cabin Fever Hurley split an Apollo chocolate bar in half to offer it to Ben, who was touched by the selflessness of the gesture at a moment where Ben is generally considered an enemy of the survivors. Hurley’s world view is that nobody is too far gone.

> HURLEY: Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side. I mean, Anakin—
> 

Ben’s journey towards redemption begins earlier in the finale when he flings himself in front of a falling tree to save Hurley’s life. We know from a brief conversation between Hurley and Ben in the flash sideways that they protected The Island for many years (”You know, you were a real good number two.” “And you were a great number one, Hugo.”). 

My top frustration with the finale is that we see none of this, not one scene depicting Hurley and Ben as custodians of The Island. Ben, who constantly chose evil, finally chose to be good and it actually stuck. Hurley, gentle and kind, but full of self doubt, rises to this leadership role. Yet, we don’t get to see any of it? This is a shame. Redemption is another major theme of the show 

### Wipe the Slate Clean

The reveal in the finale that the flash sideways narrative in season 6 was not an alternate universe created by The Incident, but a space between life and death was the most controversial element of the series. My understanding is that this “sideways timeline” was inspired by The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a Buddhist text that works as a guide for a person’s time in the bardo (the interval between the end of one life and the start of the next). Lost is quite explicit in its use of religious concepts for plot, themes, and symbolism. Look up what “Dharma” means to start with.

It is completely thematically consistent that Lost would include a subplot set between life and death. Ever since Jack spotted Christian Shephard on The Island in season one the barrier between this life and the next has been porous on Lost. Miles and Hurley can hear and see dead people respectively. The act of honouring the dead with a proper funeral is one of the earliest experiences our survivors go through together after the plane crash.

So many characters died over the course of the show that including a narrative arc in the afterlife is a smart way to let the audience say goodbye to the many characters we grew to care about. 

The flash sideways did more for the show than act as a bookend. I found the inclusion of the flash sideways to be narratively significant as well as emotionally resonant. The survivors arrive on The Island as lost souls, each with a mysterious, often dark, past. For most characters their time on The Island was an opportunity for a fresh start unburdened by their past. As early as episode 3, this need for a chance to begin again comes up as Kate considers coming clean about her criminality to Jack, who replies:

> JACK: I don't want to know. It doesn't matter, Kate, who we were - what we did before this, before the crash. It doesn't really... 3 days ago we all died. We should all be able to start over.
> 

Jack’s understanding that the survivors are entitled to a fresh start on The Island is strikingly similar to how Jacob describes his reasons for bringing people to The Island in season 6. I wonder if Jack was more in harmony with The Island from the start than he gets credit for.

> JACOB: That man who sent you to kill me believes that everyone is corruptible because it's in their very nature to sin. I bring people here to prove him wrong. And when they get here, their past doesn't matter.
> 

Having been granted a Tabula Rasa (clean slate) by the plane crash, the survivors are able to grow on their own terms. That is not to say that who a person was before the crash is irrelevant. We the audience see constant flashbacks offering context for each person’s on island actions. Some survivors want to run from their past, some want to atone for actions in their past, others want to leave The Island to return to something from their past. This looks different for each character, but consider Locke as an example. Locke is able to leave behind his wheelchair, which he found limiting and emasculating, and instead reinvent himself as the alpha outdoorsman he always wanted to be. 

Season 5 culminates in a plan to detonate a nuclear bomb over the pocket of electromagnetic energy the Dharma Initiative were drilling towards, resulting in The Incident. Daniel Faraday’s calculations suggested that this could alter the future, preventing Oceanic 815 from ever crashing on The Island. For Daniel, this would be a way to save Charlotte’s life, for the others it is more of a nihilistic drive to erase their entire experience of The Island, including the connections they made along the way. 

As season 6 starts we believe for a moment that the plan worked, though it becomes clear quite early on that things are not quite right in this flash sideways timeline. Although the flash sideways is not literally the “fixed” timeline where the flight did not crash, the timeline does allow us to explore what might have happened had the characters successfully wiped the slate clean. When we see, for example, that Charlie is once again an out of control rockstar. we realise how much transformation he went through on The Island. 

Each character has a transcendental revelation in the flash sideways timeline where they remember their life on The Island. This experience appears to bring on a feeling of tranquillity and togetherness. I feel that part of what brings on this rush of joy upon remembering is that each person is grateful for their time on The Island, the people they met, the ways in which they changed for the better. The time on The Island was not a mistake that needed to be corrected for by means of a bomb, but a transformative and significant part of each character’s self-actualisation. Their time on the Island didn’t interrupt their lives, it was part of their lives. 

### No Man is an Island

Our survivors are also elated to be reunited with each other. Claire sees Charlie again after he died a hero’s death for the sake of the group. Sawyer is reunited with Juliet, who he tragically lost at the end of season 5. These moments are undoubtedly touching, but they also echo that the group lose each other and have to find each other several times across the series. Jin and Sun, their relationship stronger than ever on The Island, are separated for almost two entire seasons and spend the entire time trying to find each other. Sawyer and Jack won’t get on the helicopter in season 4 without saving Hurley, who they learn is in jeopardy.

Whenever there is an attempt to escape and somebody is left behind, things go wrong. The most recent example in the series is when Claire is left behind as the remaining survivors hurry onto the submarine to escape The MiB and The Island altogether, naturally the submarine explodes. Claire, having been claimed by The MiB, is constantly at threat of being left behind across season 6. Seeing her on the plane heading back to Aaron is a satisfying moment. An important principle in Lost is that nobody left behind. 

In the flash sideways the gang have to find each other one last time. Once everybody is reunited they are ready to take the big leap of faith together, moving on. They lived together so they don’t have to die alone. This final scene is a slightly odd one, but the yellow light that envelops the cast is strikingly similar to the light source at The Heart of the Island, a small hint towards the spiritual significance of The Heart. The most satisfying explanation I found online regarding the flash sideways is that the survivors, by virtue of their connections to The Island, have formed a bond similar to the concept of the Karass in Vonnegut’s novel Cat’s Cradle. That would be a group cosmically connected, who are striving towards a greater purpose, even if the individuals themselves are not aware of what that might be. 

The storylines in Lost have a tendency to repeat themselves. Time and time again our survivors have to prepare to protect themselves from The Others, or attempt once again to leave The Island. This gives the show an existential quality. Pushing the button every 108 minutes in The Hatch evokes Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill. Narratively the characters are going around in circles, but what changes over the series is how they relate to each other. They learn to look out for one another, to accept help and support from each other. 

Lost is falsely premised as a quest to find The Chosen One, whether that is the man that will lead the survivors and call the shots or The Candidate that will succeed Jacob’s position of total authority as The Island’s protector. Consider Locke, so wrapped up in the idea of his own destiny that he is susceptible to manipulation by The MiB. The idea of a leader or a chosen one is a red herring. Lost is not the story of a singular hero. Everybody played an essential role in saving The Island. “You needed them and they needed you”.

I appreciate the Lost finale because of how explicit it makes this. The Lost writers spent too much of season 6 hastily sketching out a backstory for Jacob, drawing heavily on the Biblical tale of Cain and Abel. The consequence of this is that our cast of characters spend much of the season sitting around waiting. The Finale sees them back in action, working together to save the day. Jack could certainly be considered a hero, but Desmond’s power was required to pull the plug from The Heart. Kate shot The MiB as he overpowered Jack. Ben pushed Hurley, who would shortly become The Island’s protector, out of the way of a falling tree. Sawyer waved down the plane as it was about to take off, securing their rescue. 

The importance of the survivors to one another comes up time and time again. Before everyone is separated, all of the survivors pitch in to help Claire raise Aaron, from Locke building a cot for him to sleep in to Sawyer reading stories to help him sleep.  No wonder Claire is nervous about the possibility of raising Aaron alone - it really does take a village. One of my favourite scenes highlighting this theme is the time where Jack, typically self sufficient and independent, needs Juliet to perform an emergency appendectomy on him on the beach. 

Whether attempting to survive on a seemingly deserted island, outrunning a mysterious smoke monster, or flashing erratically through time, the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 face each mysterious and bizarre scenario together.

First, Skynet came for the bangers, then the anthems. Eventually, there was no noise at all. Welcome to the void.

What sucked up all the air out of the room? At this stage in the game, we’re all familiar with the tools I’m taking aim at: large language models, generative AI, ChatGPT, AI assistants. My concern here is focused on the threat these tools pose to humanity’s creative output, but I hope to convince you that this harm stretches far beyond the arts. We should all be freaking out.

### “Man, this shit is fucked up!”

One of the best books I read this year (so far!) was Dilla Time by Dan Charnas. The book charts the work and life of J Dilla AKA Jay Dee AKA James Dewitt Yancey, revered beat producer raised in Detroit. I’ll let this passage from the opening pages of the book, where recording engineer Bob Power is introduced to Jay Dee’s work by Q Tip, illustrate what made J Dilla’s work so special and challenging:

>“The drums were… weird. The snare drum on the backbeat landed a little off, but the kick drum just bounced all over the place. The whole thing sounded sloppy, like the kid didn’t even care where the drums fell. Like he didn’t really have much musical or technical knowledge.”

Or, in other words, “man, this shit is fucked up!”

The book does a better job than I will at explaining J Dilla’s methods, but essentially here’s what you need to know. J Dilla worked with drum machines to program beats that felt off because they subverted our rhythmic expectations. He shifted certain elements, like the snare, to come slightly early or slightly late. These shifts were microscopic, 192 slices per measure instead of the typical 8. Without J Dilla’s instrument, the drum machine, his methods would not have been possible. J Dilla took a technological innovation that people worried would kill music (digital sound, programmable drum machines) and developed a whole new sound.

J Dilla’s personal MPC3000 can now be viewed at the Smithsonian, testament to the importance of that particular machine in J Dilla’s beat making. Across the creative fields, advancements in computing can and have led to a great deal of cool new art and new forms of expression. The output of creativity and technology has always been something of a mixed bag, but even maligned technology like autotune has had its moments of magic (Rappa Ternt Sanga, 808s & Heartbreak). I am not anti computer. I say what I say because I love technology.

My contention here is that there will never be a J Dilla figure that takes generative AI and uses it in an innovative way to advance a creative industry in an unexpected and exciting direction. There will be no leap forward, only stagnation and regression. 

### The Static

We can begin by understanding the qualities that J Dilla the man had that led him to his work with the MPC3000. As Charnas phrases it, J Dilla’s work bore “the mark of a programmer, not a drummer”. Charnas challenges the supremacy of the musician as a unique creative force and considers J Dilla’s computing aptitude a key factor in his success.

>“[…] there is a fetishization of the conventional musician and a rejection of the programmer, the very person that Dilla was. Theres the idea that somehow performance is more pure than programming, instinct more important than deliberation.” 

Characterising J Dilla as a programmer, we can in turn consider the temperamental qualities and talents of a competent programmer. A programmer is patient, they understand the system that they are working with deeply, they experiment, they problem solve. AI is coming for computer programming, quickly, and with that AI is coming for our brains. We’re increasingly abandoning investigation and analysis in favour of cutting corners and saving time. It’s a future of shortcuts, hacks, and a more passive relationship with our technology. Without spending time with our tools, we will never exploit them to their full potential in the way J Dilla did with the MPC3000. Using generative AI is like using the presets. 

We must also consider the qualities of AI output itself. These tools are essentially giant prediction algorithms. This means that anything generative AI gives you is an aggregate of things that already exist. AI will give you exactly what you want, exactly what you expect. J Dilla’s work came from subverting expectations. Definitionally, generative AI’s outputs reinforce expectations. The arts move forward by shocking and confusing the audience. We may never be provoked again. 

Sorry Picasso, faces don’t look like that. Try again.

### Digital Pools

The problem is not only that AI created art is like spam. Having AI around is in itself a threat to the artist. Use of generative AI in general will suppress a person’s capacity to access their own creativity. This is because generative AI is inhibiting the very faculties the artist needs to create interesting work. The artist has in common many qualities with the programmer, particularly around focus and exploration. Crucially, the artist benefits from an increasingly endangered mental state: boredom. A lot of great ideas also come when the mind is idle. We may never be bored again.

AI is particularly pernicious when considered in tandem with social media. Why are we so obsessed with seeing ourselves as an action figure, or seeing ourselves as a Ghibli character, or as a Pixar character? Because we are Narcissus, turning to stone as we gaze into that pool. Lacking control over the big things, we inspect and prune and optimise ourselves like there’s a prize at the end. Superficially, we know ourselves better than ever. We can zoom in on our flaws, track how our face has aged over a decade of selfies, quantify our popularity and social status through likes and comments. At the same time, we are becoming disconnected from our deeper self knowledge. 

The ills of social media are well publicised. Introducing AI content into this mix is like shoving dynamite into a crack in the wall. The whole house is going to blow up. We will be severed from our time and place, from our communities and relationships. Truths and lies will be indistinguishable, but we’ll see only what we want to see. We will be so entertained that there are no thoughts left to intrude. Our eyeballs will be saturated with endless nonsense that came from nowhere, that stands for nothing.

### Out of Thin Air

Art comes from somewhere. Even the most abstract work is based on something: a mood, a feeling, an idea. 

That thing is a point of view, which is the sum total of all your tendencies, experiences, background, and preferences. Who would Wilfred Owen have been had he been spared the trenches of World War 1? What would Monet have painted if he never gardened? Notably, the blurb for Dilla Time describes the book as “equal parts biography, musicology, and cultural history”. Dan Charnas portrays the life of James Dewitt Yancey and the art of J Dilla with sensitivity and an ongoing awareness of their interconnectedness. 

All an AI generated image can be is a technical accomplishment. Not art, only content. The idea of “AI art” attempts to remove the artist from the art, ignorant to the symbiotic relationship between the two. The artist lives, develops a perspective, and transforms that perspective into art. It reminds me of the bit in Good Will Hunting where the therapist absolutely reads Will for filth, an excerpt of which is quoted below. 

>“So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written... Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help.”

Maybe a little bit cheesy, but this monologue is getting at something very real. Will lacks direct phenomenological experience with the world, so he has nothing new to say about it. Will is a young man though and he will do plenty of living. He will get his heart broken, let people down, take a risk, change his life. All AI will ever do is gobble up other people’s art and regurgitate it. You are not a baby bird, don’t eat that.

Art is not decoration. Art exists to change the world in some way. Through expressing their perspective creatively, the artist advocates for a certain vision of the world. Perhaps the artist wants our beautiful planet to be conserved and protected. Perhaps the artist hopes to encourage empathy for a misunderstood minority group. AI has no perspective to express, no cause to fight for.

### Counterprogramming

Left unchecked, this is our future. The art scene will be flooded with AI generated content. The artist will be both unemployed and in a permanent state of writers block, subject to the same insatiable itch to scroll on as the rest of us. The audience will be numb, with no patience or thoughtfulness with which to appreciate any art, let alone distinguish good art from bad. We will lose the transformative power of the arts. 

Not wanting to present a problem without offering a solution, I have a few thoughts on how the individual can strike back. First up, limit your use of generative AI and LLMs, particularly for tasks that you used to pride yourself on having an aptitude for. A writer using an LLM to write their articles for them is a disgrace, no doubt about it. Do not engage with AI content on social media. Do not repost it. Do not rush to your chatbot of choice to join in. 

My second suggestion is more positive, which is to learn something new from scratch, who cares what it is. Learn to throw ceramics on a pottery wheel. Learn how to fix a broken watch. Learn to play your favourite song on piano. Learn how to code, how to meditate, how to bake a cake. The frustrations and breakthroughs you go through along the way will cultivate patience, focus, exploration, and introspection. The revelation is in the process.
